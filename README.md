Observations (Part 1 - Weather)
1. There is a relatively strong negative correlation (r = 0.71) between maximum temperature and latitude for the northern hemisphere. In other words, the further the city is from the equator in the northern hemisphere, the lower the maximum temperature is.
2. There is a weaker positive correlation (r = 0.49) between maximum temperature and latitude for the southern hemisphere.
3. There does not appear to be much of a relationship betwen latitude and cloudiness. In other words, city latitude does not necessarily predict cloudiness. A similar observation can be made between latitude and wind speed
